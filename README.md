### Setting Up the Webhook URL

Before the form will work, you need to update the webhook URL in the code:

1. **Edit the JavaScript**:
   - Open `index.html` in your code editor
   - Find this line (around line 204):
   ```javascript
   const WEBHOOK_URL = 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE';
   ```
   
2. **Replace with your actual webhook URL**:
   ```javascript
   const WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://your-actual-webhook-url.com/webhook';
   ```

3. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Update webhook URL"

Cloudflare Pages will automatically redeploy your site with the new webhook URL.
